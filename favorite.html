                    and so far I enjoy using acrylic yarn more because it is cheaper. Also, it allows 
                    me to add more details to the amigurumi.

                    and there are a lot of special effects I can do digitally. I used to draw to the point 
                    where my wrist felt like it was broken, but now I rarely draw for myself.
